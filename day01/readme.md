# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is the science of making machines think and act like humans. It is a broad field that includes anything where a computer or machine performs tasks that normally require human intelligence.

Key Abilities of AI:

Understanding language (e.g., ChatGPT understanding your question)

Solving problems

Recognizing images

Learning from experience

Making decisions

Example:

- A robot that can talk, walk, and respond to your voice is an example of AI.

- Virtual assistants like Siri or Google Assistant use AI to understand your voice and help you.


2. Machine Learning (ML) – "A Subfield of AI"
Definition:

Machine Learning is a subset of AI. It is a method that allows machines to learn from data and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed.

How It Works:

Instead of writing rules, we feed the machine a lot of data, and it learns patterns from that data.

Types of ML:

Supervised Learning: Learn from labeled data (like learning from answers)

Unsupervised Learning: Learn patterns from data without labels

Reinforcement Learning: Learn by trial and error (like training a dog with rewards)

Example:

If we give a model 1000 pictures of cats and dogs (with labels), the model will learn to tell the difference between a cat and a dog. This is supervised learning.

3. Deep Learning (DL) – "A Subfield of ML"
Definition:

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. It uses a special type of model called a neural network with many layers (that’s why it's called "deep").

It is inspired by how the human brain works. DL is especially powerful when working with large amounts of data, like images, audio, or natural language.

Why Deep Learning?

Deep learning can automatically find very complex patterns in data, which traditional ML may miss.

Example:

When Facebook automatically tags your friends in a photo using face recognition — that’s deep learning.

ChatGPT (what you're using now) is based on deep learning models.
